**Svelte Easyroute** - is a simple and convenient router for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework. It is good svelte router shich supports history and hash mode, navigation guards, base path. If you need svelte router, try this one.

>A few words about router:
>* Create powerful SPA's with Svelte! Navigate between components without page reloading;
>* Get information from query string and dynamicly matched routes;
>* Programmatic navigation by URL string or by name;
>* Navigation hooks before leaving current route and after loading new;
>* Easy access to route parameters with simple "export let *" svelte variables;
>* Create router links with text or any other content you like;
>* Define your app base url;
>* Define your app default component for undefined urls;
>* Use one of three modes: hash (adds '#' symbol in address bar); history (uses History API); silent (uses built-in history and not changes current url in address bar);
>* Use CSS-transitions just outside the box.

Why you should try it? 

>**1. Well-known syntax**
>I was inspired by the router for Vue.js, so this router will be understandable to many of you
>
>**2. Still developing**
